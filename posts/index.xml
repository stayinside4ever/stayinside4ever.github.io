      <description>I have been collecting a few quotes from lecturers on the front cover of my paper pad. Since I am starting a new pad, I will dump the quotes here for now.
 A massive, giant octopus like that is always a sign of something gone wrong.

      <description>While I am not exactly sure of how I acquired this reputation (quite possibly by having 40 unread books in my room at any time and almost always carrying about 5 around), a bunch of lecturers know me as the book kid at this point. Sam will occasionally check what I am reading and we might have a little discussion about it, other students will ask me if my current read is any good&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Just dug up this site from a pile of memories, lines of lost code, and a bunch of junk. Whew.
The current idea is to use this as a journal to keep track of my academic journey. This may as well change. The most important thing here is to not just quit like I did last time, last year around this same time. Keep writing something, no matter how insignificant I find it, because the future me will find it more interesting than the current me does anyway.</description>

      <description>I’ve left this site abandoned for quite some time, but now I am in need of a place to host a small choose-your-own-adventure game I am making, so I will be using this site here again. I might post stuff about other projects I am working on at the moment too every now and then, if only to keep track of everything myself. They say that writing things down helps organize one’s thoughts.</description>

      <title>Drawabox Lesson 1</title>
      <link>https://stayinside4ever.github.io/posts/drawabox-lesson-1/</link>

      <description>I started Drawabox lessons back in autumn. I never had the patience or willpower to stick through all of them, so I slowly started doing less and less after finishing Lesson 1. Never put that up for critique, either, because I was scared of criticism, since I’m quite harsh on myself as it is. But now I want to start doing the lessons again from scratch, so I’m putting what I have done up for critique, to know where I should improve this time around.</description>

      <description>This is a fortress diary for my splinter for the splinter project “Menaces With Splinters” for the game Dwarf Fortress. Read more about the project on its subreddit. Also, I called my fort Bluehammers because I want to have a squad of hammerdwarves with blue cloaks. No reason for that, though.

We finally have an underground well next to our dormitory/hospital area. No more running to the nearby brook!</description>

 We have arrived!
After digging a staircase to the caves (and then closing it at the lowest level), we set up a few workshops on the surface and some stockpiles below ground.</description>
