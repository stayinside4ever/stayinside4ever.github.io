            <p>This is a fortress diary for my splinter for the splinter project &ldquo;Menaces With Splinters&rdquo; for the game Dwarf Fortress. Read more about the project on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/menaceswithsplinters">its subreddit</a>.
Also, I called my fort Bluehammers because I want to have a squad of hammerdwarves with blue cloaks. No reason for that, though.</p>

<hr />

<p>We have arrived!</p>

<p>After digging a staircase to the caves (and then closing it at the lowest level), we set up a few workshops on the surface and some stockpiles below ground. The woodcutter is busy. Things are looking good so far.</p>

<p>We proceed to dig out the animal pasture area, plan out the bedroom area and dig out a few other doors, out of which one is soon becoming a temporary dormitory.</p>

<p>On 17th of Limestone, first caravan arrives. However, there&rsquo;s no outpost liaison! How curious&hellip; We let our fellow dwarves unpack their things, then deconstruct the trading post. No shame in that, since they&rsquo;re gonna get a lot of profit from us in the coming years&hellip;. in the form of mugs. Lots and lots of mugs. We set up a stockpile under everything they dropped to prevent things from rotting.</p>

<p>In Felsite, we&rsquo;ve finally finished building most of the wall that&rsquo;s going to surround our fortress! There&rsquo;s still more planning for the interior, but the exterior wall is done. Next step in our fort&rsquo;s defenses is digging a moat around the wall.</p>

<p>This year was not very eventful - a couple migrant waves here and there, a couple kobold thieves, a bolt-stealing kea. But the calmness is good, given that we&rsquo;re still setting our fort up. Onto the next year!</p>

<hr />

<p>Total dwarves at the end of the year: 16</p>

<p>Starting 7 still alive</p>
