		<p>This is a fortress diary for my splinter for the splinter project “Menaces With Splinters” for the game Dwarf Fortress. Read more about the project on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MenacesWithSplinters/">its subreddit</a>. Also, I called my fort Bluehammers because I want to have a squad of hammerdwarves with blue cloaks. No reason for that, though.</p>
<hr>
<p>We have arrived!</p>
<p>After digging a staircase to the caves (and then closing it at the lowest level), we set up a few workshops on the surface and some stockpiles below ground. The woodcutter is busy. Things are looking good so far.</p>
<p>We proceed to dig out the animal pasture area, plan out the bedroom area and dig out a few other doors, out of which one is soon becoming a temporary dormitory.</p>
<p>On 17th of Limestone, first caravan arrives. However, there’s no outpost liaison! How curious… We let our fellow dwarves unpack their things, then deconstruct the trading post. No shame in that, since they’re gonna get a lot of profit from us in the coming years… in the form of mugs. Lots and lots of mugs. We set up a stockpile under everything they dropped to prevent things from rotting.</p>
<p>In Felsite, we’ve finally finished building most of the wall that’s going to surround our fortress! There’s still more planning for the interior, but the exterior wall is done. Next step in our fort’s defenses is digging a moat around the wall.</p>
<p>This year was not very eventful - a couple migrant waves here and there, a couple kobold thieves, a bolt-stealing kea. But the calmness is good, given that we’re still setting our fort up. Onto the next year!</p>
<hr>
<p>Total dwarves at the end of the year: 16</p>
<p>Starting 7 still alive</p>
