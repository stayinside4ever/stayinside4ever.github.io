		<p>I started Drawabox lessons back in autumn. I never had the patience or willpower to stick through all of them, so I slowly started doing less and less after finishing Lesson 1. Never put that up for critique, either, because I was scared of criticism, since I’m quite harsh on myself as it is. But now I want to start doing the lessons again from scratch, so I’m putting what I have done up for critique, to know where I should improve this time around.</p>
<p>Oh, also, one page of the sketchbook (the more yellow-ish paper) is about the size of an A3 paper sheet, only more square in shape. The white-ish pages are A4. This is more of a note for future me who will have forgotten which ones are which and that I even had a big sketchbook.</p>
<p>So, first off, <strong>superimposed</strong> lines. I’m actually kinda proud of the straight ones, since I have shaky hands.</p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_1.jpg" alt="Superimposed lines 1"></p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_2.jpg" alt="Superimposed lines 2"></p>
<p>Next up, <strong>ghosting.</strong> Only one page, as was said in the homework.</p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_3.jpg" alt="Ghosted lines"></p>
<p>After that, <strong>planes exercise</strong>. Yes, I got lazy when I got to the second page.</p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_4.jpg" alt="Planes 1"></p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_5.jpg" alt="Planes 2"></p>
<p><strong>Ellipse tables</strong>! These were actually quite fun to draw, haha.</p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_6.jpg" alt="Ellipse tables 1"></p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_7.jpg" alt="Ellipse tables 2"></p>
<p><strong>Funnels</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_8.jpg" alt="Funnels"></p>
<p>The <strong>2 point perspective</strong> exercise! The white pages are starting to appear, since I did most of these away from home.</p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_9.jpg" alt="2 point perspective 1"></p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_10.jpg" alt="2 point perspective 2"></p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_11.jpg" alt="2 point perspective 3"></p>
<p><strong>1 point perspective</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_12.jpg" alt="1 point perspective 1"></p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_13.jpg" alt="1 point perspective 2"></p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_14.jpg" alt="1 point perspective 3"></p>
<p><strong>Rotating boxes</strong>. My nightmare. Don’t ask why I tried doing the huge thing, I don’t know either.</p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_15.jpg" alt="Rotated boxes 1"></p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_16.jpg" alt="Rotated boxes 2"></p>
<p>And finally, the <strong>organic perspective</strong> exercise. Man, this was hell, too.</p>
<p><img src="/drawabox/1_17.jpg" alt="Organic perspective"></p>
<p>Aaaand that’s it! Hope to hear your thoughts in the comments of my reddit post!</p>
