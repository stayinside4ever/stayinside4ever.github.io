		<p>While I am not exactly sure of how I acquired this reputation (quite possibly by having 40 unread books in my room at any time and almost always carrying about 5 around), a bunch of lecturers know me as the book kid at this point. Sam will occasionally check what I am reading and we might have a little discussion about it, other students will ask me if my current read is any good&hellip;</p>
<p>My reading tastes also vary quite greatly - for example, this week I am reading Hemingway (Islands in the Stream and The Old Man and the Sea, to be exact), Musicology by Joseph Kerman, essays on software engineering (The Mythical Man-Month), a bunch of graphic novels (Pyongyang and Shenzhen by Guy Delisle), Ancient Greek plays (Medea, The Phoenician Women, and Bacchae by Euripedes). Thankfully, people find it very easy to respect.</p>
<p>Would I complain if this were how people were going to remember me? Definitely not.</p>
<p><em>Also, I have come to the conclusion that walks through the forest and unexplored parts of the city when it&rsquo;s sunny outside is an entire treat, especially when the day has been grand so far in general.</em></p>
