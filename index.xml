      <description>I’ve left this site abandoned for quite some time, but now I am in need of a place to host a small choose-your-own-adventure game I am making, so I will be using this site here again. I might post stuff about other projects I am working on at the moment too every now and then, if only to keep track of everything myself. They say that writing things down helps organize one’s thoughts.</description>

      <title>Drawabox Lesson 1</title>

      <description>I started Drawabox lessons back in autumn. I never had the patience or willpower to stick through all of them, so I slowly started doing less and less after finishing Lesson 1. Never put that up for critique, either, because I was scared of criticism, since I’m quite harsh on myself as it is. But now I want to start doing the lessons again from scratch, so I’m putting what I have done up for critique, to know where I should improve this time around.</description>

      <description>This is a fortress diary for my splinter for the splinter project “Menaces With Splinters” for the game Dwarf Fortress. Read more about the project on its subreddit. Also, I called my fort Bluehammers because I want to have a squad of hammerdwarves with blue cloaks. No reason for that, though.

We finally have an underground well next to our dormitory/hospital area. No more running to the nearby brook!</description>

 We have arrived!
After digging a staircase to the caves (and then closing it at the lowest level), we set up a few workshops on the surface and some stockpiles below ground.</description>
